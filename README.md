# Attendance-System-with-face_recognition
It is a tool which can be use to manage one's attendance system. 
The tool uses face recognition  library to match the faces and then mark the attendance with name and time. 
Any new addition to the images will make program to identify that face too.
Currently, the program uses some actors images and detect them who eventually happens to be in the witcher's cast.
